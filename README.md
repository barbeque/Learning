This is my repository for small utilities or learning apps that I write and check in to learn about git (and various languages and toolkits).

There's also a lot of useless one-off code lying around that I needed to back up somewhere. I tinker with a lot of different things. Let me know if any of it becomes useful for you, or send a pull request if it's so bad that it offends you.
